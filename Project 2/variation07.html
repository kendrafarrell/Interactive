	<h1>Variation 7</h1>
	<h3><em>When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer</em></h3>
	When I heard the learn’d astronomer, 
	<br>
	When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me, 
	<br>
	When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them, 
	<br>
	When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, 
	<br>
	How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, 
	<br>
	Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself, 
	<br>
	In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, 
	<br>
	Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.
	<br>
	<br>
	- Walt Whitman
