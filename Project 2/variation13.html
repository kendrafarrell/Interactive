		<h3><em>When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer</em></h3>

	<div class="general" id="body1">
		When I heard the learn’d astronomer, 
		<br>
		When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me, 
		<br>
		When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them, 
		<br>
		When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, 
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="general" id="body2">	
		How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, 
		<br>
		Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself, 
		<br>
		In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, 
		<br>
		Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.
