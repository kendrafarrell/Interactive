	Variation 5
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer
	<br>
	<br>
	When I heard the learn’d astronomer,  <br><br> When the proofs, <br>the figures, <br> were ranged in columns before me,  <br><br> When I was shown the charts and diagrams, <br> to add, <br> divide, <br> and measure them,  <br><br> When I sitting heard the astronomer <br> where he lectured <br> with much applause in the lecture-room,  <br><br> How soon unaccountable <br> I became tired and sick,  <br><br> Till rising and gliding out <br>I wander’d off by myself,  <br><br> In the mystical moist night-air, <br> and from time to time,  <br><br> Look’d up in perfect silence <br> at the stars.
	<br>
	<br>
