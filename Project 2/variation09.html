	<h3><em>When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer</em></h3>

	When I heard the learn’d astronomer, 
	<br>
	When 
	<ul>
		<li>the proofs,</li> 
		<li>the figures,</li> 
	</ul>
	were ranged in columns before me, 
	<br>
	When I was shown 
	<ul>
		<li>the charts and </li>
		<li>diagrams, to </li>  
			<ol>
			<li> add, </li> 
			<li> divide, and </li> 
			<li> measure them,  </li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<br>
	When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, 
	<br>
	How soon unaccountable I became 
		<ul>
			<li> tired and </li>
			<li> sick,  </li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself, 
	<br>
	In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, 
	<br>
	Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.
	<br>
	<br>
	- Walt Whitman
