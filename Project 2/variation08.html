	<h3><em>When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer</em></h3>

	When I heard the <strong>learn’d astronomer</strong>, 
	<br>
	When the <strong>proofs</strong>, the <strong>figures</strong>, were ranged in <strong>columns</strong> before me, 
	<br>
	When I was shown the <strong>charts</strong> and <strong>diagrams</strong>, to add, divide, and measure them, 
	<br>
	When I sitting heard the <strong>astronomer</strong> where he lectured with much applause in the <strong>lecture-room</strong>, 
	<br>
	How soon unaccountable I became <strong>tired</strong> and <strong>sick</strong>, 
	<br>
	Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself, 
	<br>
	In the <strong>mystical moist night-air</strong>, and from time to time, 
	<br>
	Look’d up in perfect silence at the <strong>stars</strong>.
	<br>
	<br>
	- Walt Whitman
